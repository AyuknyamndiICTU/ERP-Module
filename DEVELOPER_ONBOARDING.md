# 👨‍💻 Developer Onboarding Checklist

## ✅ Prerequisites Setup

### Required Software
- [ ] Node.js >= 16.0.0
- [ ] npm >= 8.0.0  
- [ ] PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Git
- [ ] Code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Clone repository
- [ ] Install dependencies: `npm run setup`
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Configure environment variables (see .env.example if available)
- [ ] Run migrations: `npm run migrate`
- [ ] Seed sample data: `npm run seed`

## 🚀 First Run
- [ ] Start development servers: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Verify frontend loads at http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Verify backend API at http://localhost:3001/api
- [ ] Check API documentation at http://localhost:3001/api-docs
- [ ] Test login with seeded user credentials

## 📚 Understanding the Codebase

### Architecture Overview
- [ ] Read `README.md` for project overview
- [ ] Review `CODEBASE_INDEX.md` for detailed structure
- [ ] Check `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for common commands
- [ ] Use `FILE_MAP.md` to navigate source files

### Key Concepts
- [ ] Understand the 3 main modules: Academic, Finance, HR
- [ ] Review role-based access control system
- [ ] Examine API route structure in `backend/src/routes/`
- [ ] Study React component hierarchy in `frontend/src/`

### Code Patterns
- [ ] Backend: Express routes + Sequelize models + JWT auth
- [ ] Frontend: React hooks + Material-UI + Context API
- [ ] Error handling: Global error boundary + API interceptors
- [ ] Testing: Jest for both frontend and backend

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Making Changes
- [ ] Create feature branch from main
- [ ] Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- [ ] Add tests for new functionality
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] Format code: `npm run format`
- [ ] Test changes: `npm run test`

### Code Quality
- [ ] ESLint configuration for both frontend and backend
- [ ] Prettier for consistent formatting
- [ ] Husky pre-commit hooks for automated checks
- [ ] Jest testing setup with coverage reports

### Common Tasks
- [ ] Adding new API endpoint: Create route in `backend/src/routes/`
- [ ] Adding new page: Create component in `frontend/src/pages/`
- [ ] Database changes: Update migrations in `backend/src/database/`
- [ ] New UI component: Add to `frontend/src/components/`

## 🗄️ Database Understanding
- [ ] Review database schema (50+ tables)
- [ ] Understand Sequelize ORM patterns
- [ ] Learn migration and seeding process
- [ ] Study relationship mappings between entities

## 🔐 Security Considerations
- [ ] JWT token handling and refresh
- [ ] Role-based access control implementation
- [ ] Input validation with Joi schemas
- [ ] CORS and security headers configuration

## 📖 Documentation
- [ ] API documentation via Swagger UI
- [ ] Component documentation in source files
- [ ] Requirements in SRS documents
- [ ] Architecture decisions in README

## 🧪 Testing Strategy
- [ ] Backend API testing with Supertest
- [ ] Frontend component testing with React Testing Library
- [ ] Integration testing between frontend and backend
- [ ] Coverage reports and quality gates

## 🚀 Deployment Knowledge
- [ ] Docker configuration in docker-compose files
- [ ] Environment variable management
- [ ] Production build process
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline (if implemented)
